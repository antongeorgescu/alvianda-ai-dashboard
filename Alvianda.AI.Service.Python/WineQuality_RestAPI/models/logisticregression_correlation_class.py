# A Pearson correlation was used to identify which features correlate with wine quality. It looks as if higher the alcohol content the higher the quality. Lower density and volatile acidity also correlated with better quality as seen in the pairwise correlation chart the chart below.

# ### About Confusion Matrix
# 
# A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") 
# on a set of test data for which the true values are known.
# 
# Here is a set of the most basic terms, which are whole numbers (not rates):
# 1. true positives (TP): These are cases in which we predicted "yes" where it is actually "yes".
# 2. true negatives (TN): We predicted no, and it is actually "no".
# 3. false positives (FP): We predicted "yes", and was actually "no" (Also known as a "Type I error."
# 4. false negatives (FN): We predicted "no", and was actually "yes". (Also known as a "Type II error.")
#     
# This is a list of rates that are often computed from a confusion matrix for a binary classifier:
# 
# **Accuracy**: Overall, how often is the classifier correct? 
#     <br>&emsp;accuracy = (TP+TN)/total
# 
# **Misclassification Rate**: Overall, how often is it wrong? 
#     <br>&emsp;misrate = (FP+FN)/total
#     <br>&emsp;equivalent to 1 minus Accuracy
#     <br>&emsp;also known as "Error Rate"
# 
# **True Positive Rate**: When it's actually yes, how often does it predict yes? 
#     <br>&emsp;tprate = TP/actual_yes
#     <br>&emsp;also known as "Sensitivity" or "Recall"
# 
# **False Positive Rate**: When it's actually no, how often does it predict yes?
#     <br>&emsp;fprate = FP/actual_no
# 
# **True Negative Rate**: When it's actually no, how often does it predict no? 
#     <br>&emsp;tnrate = TN/actual_no
#     <br>&emsp;equivalent to 1 minus False Positive Rate
#     <br>&emsp;also known as "Specificity"
# 
# **Precision**: When it predicts yes, how often is it correct? 
#     <br>&emsp;precision = TP/predicted_yes
# 
# **Prevalence**: How often does the yes condition actually occur in our sample? 
#     <br>&emsp;prevalence = actual_yes/total
